= Attribute Cartographer

* http://github.com/krishicks/attribute-cartographer

== DESCRIPTION

Attribute Cartographer allows you to map an attributes hash into similarly or differently named methods, using an optional block to map the values as well.

== INSTALL

Add attribute-cartographer to your Gemfile

  gem 'attribute-cartographer'

Then run:

  $ bundle

== USAGE
  class Mapper
    include AttributeCartographer

    map :a
    map :b, ->(v) { v.downcase }

    map :c, :d
    map :e, :f, ->(v) { v.downcase }
    map :g, :h, ->(v) { v.downcase }, ->(v) { v.upcase }

    map [:i, :j, :k]
    map [:l, :m, :n], ->(v) { v.upcase }
  end

  mapper = Mapper.new { a: 2, b: "STRING" }

  For each mapping defined, an instance method is created for the key
  to map to with the optional lambda having been called with the original value.
  If an optional second lambda is provided, that will be used to do the reverse mapping.
  The second lambda is only able to be passed when the key is being mapped to a new key.

  Mapper#original_attributes is the original hash passed in
  Mapper#mapped_attributes is a hash representing the mapped keys and their mapped values
